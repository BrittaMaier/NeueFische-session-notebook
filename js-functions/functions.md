Welcome to deep-dive with Britta!

Today's topic: What the hell?? JS functions??

Covering these main points:

- What does function declaring, arrow functions and function expression mean?
- Why and when should I do what?
- Why do we use () in some cases and not in others??

Ok, so, first: Big thank you to Anna and Rita for your support, jokes and gifs. Thanks to Susie for hosting us. Also, props to ChatGPT for relentlessly answering my questions and translating my head farts concerning everyday metaphors into logical stories I can follow.

Small recap:
Functions are parts of code that we don't want to be located in one fixed place in our code. Instead we want to use them more flexible for example only in certain situations (events) and/or multiple times at different locations without having to copy and paste the same code everywhere. This combines the Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle and flexibility.

Lego-bricks-approach:
A function some mandatory parts to work.
One is the function body `{}`. The function body contains the code of the function. Another part is the parameter list `()`
